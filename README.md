### Introduction to the Data
From "Data Analysis Project Information":

You have been hired by the “Future 500” magazine*. The stakeholders have supplied
you a list of 500 companies and would like you to create some draft visualizations for
their upcoming online publication.
They have requested the following charts:

* A scatterplot classified by industry showing revenue, expenses, profit
* A scatterplot that includes industry trends for the expenses~revenue relationship
* BoxPlots showing growth by industry

Note that the dataset has numerous discrepancies that need to be addressed before
analysis can be performed
